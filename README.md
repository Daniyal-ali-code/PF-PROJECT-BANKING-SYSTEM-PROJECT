Goals and Objectives of the Banking System Project
  Goals
    Create a Functional Banking System:
      Build a program that simulates basic banking operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
    User-Friendly Operation:
      Design a menu-driven interface for easy navigation and interaction.
    Transactions:
      Prevent invalid operations like negative deposits or withdrawals exceeding the balance.
    Manage Memory Efficiently:
      Use dynamic memory for account objects and clean up properly to avoid memory leaks.

    Account Types:
      Create Savings and Checking accounts with appropriate features.
      Allow Savings accounts to calculate and add interest.
    Basic Transactions:
      Support deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.
      Validate inputs to ensure transactions are valid.
    Menu System:
      Provide options to create accounts, perform transactions, and display all accounts.
      Handle invalid inputs gracefully without crashing.
    Error Handling:
      Validate user inputs like account indices and transaction amounts.
      Use error-handling techniques to manage incorrect or unexpected inputs.
    Future Scalability:
      Make the program easy to extend with additional features, such as transaction history or new account types.
